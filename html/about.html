    <h1>About me</h1>
<p><img alt="that's me" src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11553271?s=460&amp;v=4" /></p>
<p>My name is Fenno Vermeij, I currently live in Ede and work at Ynformed in Utrecht (which is a daughter company of RoyalHaskoningDHV).</p>
<p>I am currently very interested in Bayesian Statistics, API design, and Cloud infrastructure. I also really enjoy talking about Data Science and sharing new things, which my colleagues have noticed :).</p>
<p>Some technologies I regularly work with include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python, with the usual packages such as pandas, numpy, sklearn</li>
<li>Azure. I have an AZ-900 certificate (Azure Fundamentals), and finished studying for the AZ-204 certificate (Developer associate), but exam centers are closed due to coronavirus :(<ul>
<li>Technologies I have experience with include App services, Function Apps, Container Registries, ARM templates, (Postgres and Azure) SQL, PowerBI, Logic Apps. But this is an ever growing list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>R, using tidyverse as well as shiny for dashboards</li>
<li>Server management of several Ubuntu servers</li>
<li>Docker, including of course docker-compose.</li>
<li>I am in the process of learning Kubernetes and Terraform</li>
<li>Some basic web design</li>
<li>Flask for web api's</li>
<li>Python packages such as shapely and geopandas, and R packages such as leaflet to work with geodata</li>
<li>Git of course, as well as using Azure Devops pipelines for automation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>I took some inspiration from <a href="https://koaning.io">koaning.io</a> for the general design of the website. I don't consider myself a designer, but I liked his design a lot so I implemented something quite similar to it. Also, thanks to <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website">thebestmotherfucking.website</a> for a minimalistic design of the article body.</p>
