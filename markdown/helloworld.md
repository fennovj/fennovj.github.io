Emphasis, with *asterisks* or __underscores__.

* A list

    * With a sublist
    * Spaces only of course

## Code

You can include inline code: `x = 3` like that.

    x = 'code'
    y = 'block'

Example with highlighting:

    #!python
    # This requires the 'pygments' package to be installed.
    # Without that, this will look like unhighlighted code.
    x = 'code'
    y = 'highlight'
