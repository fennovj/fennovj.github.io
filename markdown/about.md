# About me

My name is Fenno Vermeij, I currently live in Ede and work at Ynformed in Utrecht (which is a daughter company of RoyalHaskoningDHV).

I am currently very interested in Bayesian Statistics, API design, and Cloud infrastructure. I also really enjoy talking about Data Science and sharing new things, which my colleagues have noticed :).

Some technologies I regularly work with include:

* Python, with the usual packages such as pandas, numpy, sklearn
* R, using tidyverse as well as shiny for dashboards
* Server management of several Ubuntu servers
* Docker
* I am in the process of learning Kubernetes and Terraform
* Some basic web design
* Flask for web api's
* Python packages such as shapely and geopandas, and R packages such as leaflet to work with geodata
* Git of course, including dabbling in jenkins for automation

## Contributions

I want to thank [koaning.io](https://koaning.io) for inspiration about a minimalistic design for the front page. I ended up making something by myself that still looks quite similar to his.
