# About me

My name is Fenno Vermeij, I currently live in Ede and work at Ynformed in Utrecht (which is a daughter company of RoyalHaskoningDHV).

I am currently very interested in Bayesian Statistics, API design, and Cloud infrastructure. I also really enjoy talking about Data Science and sharing new things, which my colleagues have noticed :).

Some technologies I regularly work with include:

* Python, with the usual packages such as pandas, numpy, sklearn
* Azure. I have an AZ-900 certificate (Azure Fundamentals), and finished studying for the AZ-204 certificate (Developer associate), but exam centers are closed due to coronavirus :(
    * Technologies I have experience with include App services, Function Apps, Container Registries, ARM templates, (Postgres and Azure) SQL, PowerBI, Logic Apps. But this is an ever growing list.
* R, using tidyverse as well as shiny for dashboards
* Server management of several Ubuntu servers
* Docker, including of course docker-compose.
* I am in the process of learning Kubernetes and Terraform
* Some basic web design
* Flask for web api's
* Python packages such as shapely and geopandas, and R packages such as leaflet to work with geodata
* Git of course, as well as using Azure Devops pipelines for automation.

## Contributions

I took some inspiration from [koaning.io](https://koaning.io) for the general design of the website. I don't consider myself a designer, but I liked his design a lot so I implemented something quite similar to it. Also, thanks to [thebestmotherfucking.website](https://thebestmotherfucking.website) for a minimalistic design of the article body.
