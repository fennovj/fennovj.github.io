# fenno.dev

Code for personal website. This is still very much a work in progress for now.

Hosted on [fenno.dev](https://fenno.dev) with github pages.

I am not planning on adding 'advanced' features like search or tags for articles, because I am not expecting anyone to read this website anyway. 

The goals of this website are as follows:

* Get experience with making a website as a personal hobby project. A website is a natural choice for a hobby project because it can be used to write about future hobby projects (if any)!
* If I have time and enjoy writing it, act as sort of a 'professional diary' that I can store programming lessons for my future self. Also for stuff that is interesting to write a little about, but too basic to share with colleagues.

## Instructions

Other than index.html and about.html (which are in the root directory), all other static content is located in the 'html', 'js' and 'css' directories.

Also, other than the index.html and about.html, all other pages are markdowns that are rendered inside a template html. This can be done by running 'scripts/pre-commit.py'. For convenience sake, this can be done as a pre-commit hook. To install this pre-commit hook, run the command `ln -s -f ../../scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit. This will automatically render all html with the latest template, and add it to the commit.
